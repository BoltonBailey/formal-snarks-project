from the paper proof:

"The terms with indeterminate alpha^2"    -> 2022
"The terms with indeterminate alpha beta" -> 1122
"The terms with indeterminate beta^2"     -> 0222
"The terms involving 1/delta^2"           -> This is a bit broken in the paper, but I think its probably [0020, 1020, 0120, 2020, 1120, 0220]
"The terms involving 1/gamma^2"
"beta gamma"  -> 0123
"alpha gamma" -> 1023

# Formalization of SNARKs

This repository implements a formal verification of a variety of SNARK proof systems, using the [Lean Theorem Prover](https://leanprover.github.io/), in the Algebraic Group Model. This is a work in progress.

As of now there are 6 complete soundness proofs. The full proofs of these theorems can be found at the end of `knowledge_soundness.lean` in their respective directories.

There is also a file `snark_transformations` containing various functions for manipulating SNARKs.
